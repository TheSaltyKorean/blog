Every now and then I keep promising myself I'm going to start blogging again.  So here's yet another attempt.

This time I've decided to use GitHub Pages to host the blog.  It took a little bit of work, but I've pulled all the old blog posts from the past and they are now all hosted by GitHub and using Jekyll and Markdown.

I'm currently using Typora to write the new pages but it'll be interesting to see how it works long term, as there have traditionally been some amazing blog writing tools.  Oddly enough I switched over to Visual Studio Code to finish this post.
