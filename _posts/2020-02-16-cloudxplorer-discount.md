For years working with blobs in Azure storage, my go to favorite tool has been [Clumsyleaf's CloudXplorer](http://clumsyleaf.com/products/cloudxplorer).

For 20% off, please use the code: RANDY20OFF

They've actually done an amazing job keeping the app updated as it supports:
> Azure Blobs
> Office 365 Sharepoint
> Box
> Oracle Cloud Storage
> Rackspace Cloud Files
> Amazon Cloud Drive
> Google Drive
> Microsoft OneDrive
> etc

It's my favorite because of the drag and drop capability.  Some of the utilities out there are more FTP like, but this one works like Windows Explorer.
