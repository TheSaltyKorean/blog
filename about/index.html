        <h2 class="section-title mb-20">About Randy Walker</h2>

        <p class="lead">Seasoned technology leader with over two decades of experience aligning technology strategy with business goals across dynamic industries. Proven track record in managing IT infrastructure, driving digital transformation, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver scalable, secure, and innovative solutions.</p>

        <p>I'm currently the owner of <strong>SK Meridian LLC</strong>, a technology company based in Austin, Texas focused on software development, cloud infrastructure, and platform engineering. Previously I served as <strong>Director of IT Strategy and Infrastructure at Bizzz Buzzz Technology &amp; Consulting</strong>, where I directed IT modernization for healthcare and enterprise clients, delivering a multi-phase cloud roadmap resulting in a projected $9M ROI while ensuring HIPAA compliance.</p>

        <p>Before that I was <strong>Head of Cloud Architecture and Operations at Performance Food Group</strong>, where I oversaw a $12M annual cloud budget and led the migration of 1,200+ Windows and Linux servers — including IBM i-Series LPARs — into Azure and IBM Cloud under a Zero Trust security model. I also established their Cloud Center of Excellence and built out FinOps frameworks to manage cost accountability across the enterprise.</p>

        <h3>Earlier Career</h3>

        <p>I founded <strong>Harvest Data Corp</strong> in 2005 and ran it for fourteen years as a Micro ISV focused on ETL products for retail giants including Walmart's Retail Link and Dollar General's 1010Data systems. I managed the full product lifecycle — from requirements and architecture to sales, marketing, and financial oversight — and built the entire infrastructure on Azure IaaS and PaaS. Harvest Data was an early Azure adopter; I served as a <strong>Microsoft Azure Advisor</strong> in an NDA group providing direct feedback to Microsoft's Azure product team, and was awarded over $460K in Microsoft BizSpark grants.</p>

        <p>Other roles have included <strong>Azure Architect Director at Cognizant / TriZetto Provider Solutions</strong> (managing a $5M Azure budget across 7.4M+ cloud resources with HIPAA/HITRUST compliance) and <strong>Cloud Operations Leader at Advanced Solutions International</strong>, where I led post-ransomware security remediation and drove a full Microsoft-centric cloud transformation.</p>

        <div class="space20"></div>
        <h3>Community &amp; Recognition</h3>

        <p>I was a <strong>Microsoft MVP (2008–2017)</strong> and <strong>ASP Insider (2016–present)</strong> — a small group of external advisors working directly with Microsoft's ASP.NET product team. I co-founded the <strong>Northwest Arkansas Developer Group</strong> and served on the board from 2005 to 2020, and was a Membership Mentor and Board Member of <strong>INETA</strong> (International .NET Association) from 2007 to 2009. I've spoken at local, regional, and national conferences including Microsoft TechEd.</p>
