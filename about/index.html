        <h2 class="section-title mb-20">About Me</h2>

        <p class="lead">I'm Randy Walker — a technology entrepreneur, cloud strategist, and software developer based in Austin, Texas. I've spent over two decades helping organizations use technology to grow, transform, and compete.</p>

        <p>I'm the owner of <strong>SK Meridian LLC</strong>, a technology company based in Austin focused on software development, cloud infrastructure, and platform engineering. Previously, I served as President of <strong>Harvest Data Corp</strong>, where I led enterprise data strategy and cloud transformation engagements for clients across retail, logistics, and financial services.</p>

        <p>I was recognized as a <strong>Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP)</strong> — an award given by Microsoft to independent technology experts who contribute to the developer community through speaking, writing, and open knowledge sharing. I was also an <strong>ASP Insider</strong>, part of a small group of external advisors who worked directly with Microsoft's ASP.NET product team.</p>

        <p>Earlier in my career I was deeply involved in the <strong>.NET developer community</strong> — founding and leading user groups in Northwest Arkansas, speaking at conferences like TechEd, devLink, and TechFest, and serving on the <strong>INETA (International .NET Association) Board of Directors</strong>. I was recognized as an INETA Community Champion for that work.</p>

        <h3>What I Write About</h3>

        <p>This blog has been running since 2007, which makes it something of a time capsule of the Microsoft developer ecosystem across two decades. You'll find posts ranging from early Visual Studio and SQL Server tips to Azure, Power BI, and cloud DevOps — plus the occasional take on leadership, career, and technology strategy.</p>

        <p>I write about what I'm working on, thinking about, or running into — with enough specificity to be useful and enough candor to be honest.</p>
